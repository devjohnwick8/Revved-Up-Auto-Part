            <h6>Defective Parts Picture Submission:</h6>
            <p>When you claim an item that is defective, customers will have to submit pictures of the areas where the unit is defective. Customers will also have to ship the item back for inspection.</p>
            <p>Down below will be instructions when claiming defective units and giving us picture submissions: <br>Please donâ€™t submit any pictures of installed parts</p>
            <ol>
              <li>1st Pic: A picture of the stamp engraving that appears on the brackets of the part or the sticker on the tank with the part number.</li>
              <li>2nd Pic: Overall front of unit.</li>
              <li>3rd Pic: Overall back of entire unit.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These pictures are required since the manufacturer will want to see that there is no damage to the unit (fan marks, deer horns, rock holes etc.) *These picture submissions are very important so please call or email us if you have any trouble You can send us the picture submissions via email at: <a href="mailto:customersupport@revvedupautoparts.com">customersupport@revvedupautoparts.com</a> Include your name and order number in the email so that we can create a case number for you. <br> </p>
            <p>Please Note: If you are in a rush, you can either call us to reorder the same part or you can do it online. However, the warranty claim is of no purchase to you, once your claim is submitted and processed, we will then refund you.</p>
