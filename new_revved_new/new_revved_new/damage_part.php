            <p> If you received a damaged unit then please call us or email us immediately so we can escalate your case and file the claim in order to send you a replacement or refund you.</p>
            <p>Please email us pictures of the damaged unit (take a clear picture of where the damage is) then we will submit a damage claim and issue a call tag and have our freight carrier remove the item for inspection/return. UPS or FedEx will go to your home to pick up the damaged unit after the call tag is issued.</p>
